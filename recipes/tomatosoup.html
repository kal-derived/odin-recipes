        <h2 class="rec-header">Description</h2>
        <p class="rec-section">In this recipe, the tomatoes, onions, and garlic are roasted 
            until caramelized and slightly charred, adding a sweetness and subtle smokiness to the finished dish. 
            The result is a light, yet velvety soup that feels both rustic and refined

        <ol class="rec-section">
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 C). On a large rimmed 
                baking sheet, toss tomatoes with onion, garlic, olive oil,
                 black pepper, and crushed red pepper, if using, until,
                 vegetables are evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>Roast in a preheated oven until juices are released and 
                vegetables are very soft and charrred in spots, 35-40 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer roasted vegetable mixture to a blender along with
                cream, basil, and brown sugar. Secure lid on blender, and 
                remove center piece to allow steam to escape. Place a clean 
                towel over the opening. Process until smooth, about 1 minute.

                cracked black pepper, and thinly sliced basil leaves.
